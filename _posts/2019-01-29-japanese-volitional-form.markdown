We haven't learned this in class yet. Structure wise, its not too bad, but there are a lot of nuanced uses.

<h3>Volitional Form</h3>

Structure: Modify verbals in the following way

<i>Formal</i> - Take verbal in distal `ます-form`, drop `ます`, change to `ましょう`

<i>Informal</i> - For Ichidan, drop `る`, add `よう`. For Godan, change ending kana to the corresponding `お` sound and add `う`.

<i>Informal Exceptions</i> - `する` => `しよう`, and `くる` => `こよう`

<br />

Uses: Often used similar to "let's" in English. But theres quite a few other uses. The verb really represents "volition", which is essetially human will or intention.

1 - Making a suggestion. The suggestion is usually for other people including oneself, but can be solely for other people, or oneself. Dependent on the context. Has more of a meaning of "I want this to happen, so let's do it".

`行きましょう` - "Let's go" / "Shall we go". Suggests idea to other person, but also gives the meaning that you have decided to do this already. Already made up your volition.

`座りましょうか` - "Why don't you sit down" / "Why don't we sit down"

`これを買おう` - "Let's buy this one"

`今から散歩しよう` - "(I think) I'll go for a walk now". Indicates one's intention or will of going on a walk. Less certain than just using simple present tense.

`明日までに宿題をしましょう` - "(Let's) Do your homework by tomorrow". Sounds much softer than the command version. More encouraging. NOTE: Don't say to superiors. Used very often in advertisements.

You can add the particles or use inflection to alter the emphasis

`食べましょうよ` - "Let's eat already..."

`しようか` - "Shall we do it?"

`お酒をつぎましょうか` - "Shall I pour you some sake?"

2 - When thinking out loud while debating choices or expressing what you will / try to do.

`どのゲーム買おうかね` - "(I wonder) Which game shall I buy..."

`また学校に行こうと思っている` - "I'm thinking of going to school again"

`大会に行こうと決めた` - "I decided to go to the anime convention". This is past tense of you deciding something.

`あんな男はもう忘れよう` - "I'll just forget about that guy" / "Let's just forget about that guy"

`彼と行こうと思っている` - "I'm thinking of going with him" / "I'm thinking I shall go with him". Notice the volition in choosing what you will do.

3 - Along with `ている` to continually do something.

`上っていよう` - "Let's keep climbing up"

`毎日、一緒に勉強していようね` - "Let's study together everyday, okay?"

4 - Offering to do something for someone. You can shoehorn "let's" in there. But this usuage is quite common.

`それでは私が彼に話しましょう` - "In that case, let me (let's) talk to him"

`絵を描きましょう` - "Let me (let's) draw a picture"


? - Other uses. There are some other obsure ones that I'm not quite sure how to apply since I haven't learned their grammar points yet. Here are a few.

`あなたが何をしようが自由です` - "You are free to do whatever you like". Here `しよう`, is used (as a nominal i guess?) to mean "to do what you wish / will / intent", heavily related to volition.

`何をしようとしてるの` - "What are you trying to do?". IDK the `~としてる` form or the `の` sentence particle yet.

`行こうと思ってる` - "I was thinking of going". Can use with `と` + other verbs.

`小さかった娘も、２０歳になろうとしている` - "My little daughter is turning 20 now". Used for something that is about to happen. Usually operational verbal or involves you somehow.

`電車に乗ろうとしたらドアが閉まった` - "Just as I was trying to get on the train, the door closed". Trying to do something. Again, notice the volition. Link with `とする`. idk that structure tho

See MaggieSensei/SelfTaughtJapanese link for more obscure uses and add if we see. Apparently this is used a lot. Just remember it has to do with volition.

<hr />
<h3>Volitional + っと`</h3>

Structure: Take volitional form, add `っと`. Optionally, you can drop the `う` at the end of the volitional form

Uses: Only in spoken. Used to express what you are going to do. Can use whether talking to yourself or announcing it.

`勉強しよおっと` - "I am going to study now"

`もう帰ろっと` - "I am going to go home now"

<hr />
<h3>Using with Other Forms</h3>

Can use with causative or passive form.

But not with potential form

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

`殺す` - The second radical means weapon. Treasure + Angel + Weapon = kill? Means "to kill". Pronounced "korosu"

`逃げる` - Means "to escape" / "to run away". Pronounced "nigeru"

`忘れる` - Means to forget. Pronounced "wasureru". Radicals "death" and "heart".
