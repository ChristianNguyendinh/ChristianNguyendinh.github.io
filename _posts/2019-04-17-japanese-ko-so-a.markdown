Learned most of these already, but wanted to keep a list for if we find any others.

<h3>Differences</h3>

`ど` - Interogative

<h3>List</h3>

\+ `れ` - "This/That/Which thing". Stands alone as a nominal.

\+ `こ` - "... Place/Location". Stands alone as a nominal.

\+ `ちら` - "... Direction/Location". Very broad meaning, can be used in place for the two series above as a more broad / polite version. Stands alone as a nominal.

\+ `の` - "... X". Must be attached to a nominal (X).

\+ `んな` - "... kind of X".  Must be attached to a nominal (X). Can also take particle `に` to turn into the adverb "... way/manner".

\+ `う` - "in ... way". Used as an adverb.

\+ `う言う` / `ういう` - Much less certain about this one, can't find too many resources on it. "... kind of X". Must be attached to a nominal (X). Same usage as `んな` (more casual?), but it CANNOT take `に` to become an adverb. Also used in specific instances of "how it is said" or "how I am called".
