This is much more complicated than I thought. There are many ways to express conditionals ("if" or "when") in Japanese. I will leave out some of the more nuanced rules that I don't really get. Future me can refer to the sources if i see a usage that doesn't fit with the rules I wrote down.

<h3>Method 1: と</h3>

Structure: Add `と` to a condition (predicate). The preceding condition follows the usual rules of embedded predicates: verbals in plain / direct style, adjectivals i-form without desu, and nominals + `だ`.

Use: 

1 - Describing a natural / habitual relationship, where result is non-volitional and always happens if the condition is true. 

`早く行かないと、負けります` - "If you don't go quickly, you will lose"

`たくさん食べると太るよ` - "If you eat a lot, you will get fat"

`ボールを落すと落ちる` - "If you drop the ball, it will fall"

2 - Also, can be used to recount a past series of cause and effect events. But in this case, the condition cannot be in past tense.

`窓を開けると、風が入ってきた` - "When I opened the window, the wind (a breeze) came in"

<hr />
<h3>Method 2: なら</h3>

There is also the politer version, `ならば`, which is used exactly the same.

Structure: Attach directly to plain form verbal, i-form adjectival, or nominal. Note, you don't need `だ` for the nominal.

Use: 

1 - When assuming the condition is true (based on information learned previously).

`スーパーに行くのなら、しょうゆを買ってきて` - "If you are going to the supermarket (mentioned earlier), bring back some soy sauce"

`乗るなら、飲むな` - "If you are going to drive, don't drink"

<hr />
<h3>Method 3: ば</h3>

The "provisional form" of verbals and stuff.

Structure: For verbals, take the dictionary form and change the last kana to the corresponding `え` sound and add `ば`. For adjectivals, drop the ending `い` and add `ければ`. For nominals add `であれば`, which is the `ば` form of the formal expression `である`.

Use:

1 - When talking about something that hasn't happened yet, and you want to emphasize the conditional. Can be translated to "if and only if" / "all you need to do".

`果物を食べれば健康になる` - "All you need to do to become healthy is to eat fruit"

`楽しければ、私も行く` - "Only if it is fun, I will go"

`彼女はきれいであれば、会います` - "I will meet her if and only if she is pretty"

`どうすれば、東大に入学できますか` - "To get into Tokyo University, what should I do?"

2 - When talking about what would happen if a condition (which is not true) were true.

`彼女があればいいね` - "If I had a girlfriend, it would be good, huh?"

Note, if the succeeding clause ends with a negative, it sounds unnatural, and you are better off using `と` or `たら`.

<hr />
<h3>Method 4: たら</h3>

The "conditional form" of verbals and stuff. `ならば` is the more formal version.

Structure: Take the conditional predicate, turn it into past tense, and add `ら`.

Use:

1 - Ephasises on the reaction to the condition. Commonly used if the reaction is a intent, desire, or command (that should be emphasized). Sometimes interchangable with `ば`, like if you are unsure if a future condition will be true. But, unlike `ば`, you can use `たら`, it is fact that condition will be true. And, unlike `ば`, you can also use it for things that happened in the past.

`雨が降ったら、どうしますか` - "If it rains, what should we do?" - `ば` interchangable

`午後になったら、一緒出かけましょう` - "Let's go out together in the afternoon" / "When it becomes afternoon, let's go out together" - `ば` not interchangable

`それが手紙だったら、嬉しいです` - "If it was a letter, I am happy"

2 - Can use similar to `と`, for cause and effect relationship.

`田中さんにメールを送ったら、すぐ返事が来ました` - "When I texted Ms. Tanaka, I got a reply right away"

<hr />
<h3>Side Note: もし</h3>

`もし` is used to suplement a conditional clause. It adds uncertainty to if the condition is true. Similar to "if by any chance" in English.

`もしよかったら、一緒映画を見に行きませんか` - "If by any chance it's ok, would you like to go and see a movie together?"

`もし時間がないなら、明日もいいよ` - "If, for some reason, there isn't time (you don't have time) (like you mentioned earlier), tomorrow is also good"

<hr />
<h3>Other Notes</h3>

Also I've found that these conditionals are often used to represent "when". Like:

`学校が終わったら...` - "When school ends" / "If school ends"
