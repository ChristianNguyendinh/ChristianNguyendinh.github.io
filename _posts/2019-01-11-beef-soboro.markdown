<b>Thoughts:</b>


I put way too much sauce into this one. I think my ratios were way off. Besides that, beef was pretty flavorful and sweet. Super simple meal tho. Maybe we should spice it up next time with more green stuff and an egg or something.

<b>Tier:</b> D. Maybe it will change next time if i get the ratios correct next time
