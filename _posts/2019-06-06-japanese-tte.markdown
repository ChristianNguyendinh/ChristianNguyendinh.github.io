I've seen this a little bit. Kinda looks like it has a lot of uses tho.

<h3>As a replacement for と</h3>

Can be used as a replacement to the quote particle `と`. Makes the sentence more casual.

`彼と別れたって聞いたけど本当?` - "I heard that you broke up with him, but is it true?"

`いいって思う` - "I think it is good"

`先生が今日は宿題はないって言ったよ` - "Teacher said that there is no homework today"

<hr />
<h3>As a sentence ender</h3>

You can use it to finish a sentence (can't use `と` to finish a sentence), omitting and implying the verb that follows the quote.

`今日、宿題ないんだって` - "I heard / They said that there is no homework today"

`お母さんが早く起きなさいって` - "Mom said to hurry and wake up"

Can also be used to stress a quote to show frustration.

`やめろって` - "I said stop it!"

`本当だって` - "I said is true (believe me)!"

<hr />
<h3>As a replacement for は</h3>

Can be used as a replacement for the particle `は` to introduce topics. It either emphasizes the subject, or to soften the rest of the sentence.

`仕事って難しいね` - "Work is difficult"

`マギーってかわいいね` - "You are cute, Maggie!"

`アラビア語ごって、難むずかしくない?` - "Arabic you say, isn't that difficult?"
