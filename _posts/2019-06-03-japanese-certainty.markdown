Seen most of these thrown around in class, online, and shows.

<hr />
<h3>Adverbs</h3>

`絶対` - "Absolutely" (100%)

`きっと` - "Surely" / "Undoubtedly" (~90%)

`多分` - "Probably" / "More likely than not" / "Maybe"

<hr />
<h3>でしょう</h3>

<u>Structure:</u> Use in place of the copula for nouns. For adjectives and verbs, add after the direct form. Direct/blunt version is `だろう`. (~60%?)

<u>Use:</u> Has many uses. Mainly as a less certain copula. Here, used to show a fair amount of certainty about something happening.

`明日晴れの天気でしょう` - "It will probably be clear weather tomorrow"

`たくさん勉強したから合格しただろう` - "I probably passed because I studied a lot"

<hr />
<h3>かもしれない</h3>

<u>Structure:</u> Sentence ending particle (basically, actually a verb I guess). `か` + `も` particle + "to be unable to know". Looks like people usually use direct style before the particle. Can be shortened to `かも` in casual situations.

<u>Use:</u> Shows a neutral possibility (~50% confidence).

`明日は雪が降るかもしれません` - "Maybe/Possibly it will snow tomorrow"

`母が病気だから明日は遅れるかもしれない` - "I may be late tomorrow because by mother is sick"

<hr />
<h3>Wondering</h3>

<u>でしょう/だろう + か</u> - "I wonder ..."

Ex.

`今何時だろうか?` - "What time is it? (I wonder)"

<u>っけ</u> - Sentence ending particle used when trying to recall something.

Ex.

`どこに車を停めたっけ?` - "Where did I park the car? (I wonder)"

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

- `絶対`. Defined above. Pronounced "zettai"

- `停める`. Other form of a word we already know. Means "to stop (specifically to park)", and some other stuff". Pronounced "tomeru"
