This one is pretty easy if you already know causative and passive by themselves.

<h3>Causative-Passive Form</h3>

<u>Structure:</u> conjugate into causative, then into passive. Since causative is always an ichidan, it results in a pretty consistent conjugation

<i>Ichidan Verbs</i> - Drop `る`, add `させられる`

<i>Godan Verbs</i> - change last kana like you are making a negative, then add `せられる`

<i>Exceptions</i> - `する` => `させられる`, `くる` => `こさせられる`

Again, results in an ichidan verbal.

<u>Uses:</u> 

Used to incorporate both causative and passive. The act of making someone do something had been done to them.

`が` in passive used for subject that had been actioned on. `に` was person carrying out action. Passive basically the end form, the same particle usage follows here.

`が` is the person making someone do something. `に` is the person being made to do something.

ex. 

`親に僕が毎日宿題をさせられる` - "I am made to do homework by my parents every day". Compare to `親が僕に毎日宿題をさせる` = "My parents make me do homework everyday". And `僕に毎日宿題がさられる` = "Homework is done by me every day"

`日本では、お酒を飲ませられることが多い` - "In Japan, the act of being made to drink alcohol is numerous"

<h3>Shortened Form</h3>

For SOME verbs, you can used the shortened causative to form the causative-passive.

`行かす` => `行かされる`

Ex. `学生が廊下に立たされた` - "The student was made to stand in the hall"

For verbs that would results in a shortened `さす` (ichidans and "shi" godans), you can't have さされる. Such as `食べさされる`, and `話さされる`

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

- `廊下`. We know the second kanji. Pronounced "rouka". Means "corridor; hallway".
