Just kinda looked around then based it off of that I do for the ribs.

<hr />

<b>Tools:</b>

<ul>
    <li>Baking Sheet</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<b>Ingredients:</b>

<ul>
    <li>Chicken Wings</li>
    <li>Soy sauce, sake, etc. Marinade</li>
    <li>Teriyaki Sauce</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<hr />

<b>Time:</b> 

<ul>
    <li>(night before) - Marinade</li>
    <li>45 M - Bake Chicken</li>
    <li>5 M - Toss and broil with sauce</li>
</ul>

<b>Thoughts:</b>

I think they were solid. Could've used more sauce at the end, but overall quite solid. Quite messy to eat, but not too hard at all to make. Lots of big pepper for the marinade tasted good.

<b>Tier:</b> A.
