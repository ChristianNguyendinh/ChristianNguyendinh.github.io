We haven't learned this in class yet. Doesn't seem too bad. But theres a good number of exceptions.

<h3>Potential Form</h3>

Structure: Modify verbals in the following way

<i>Ichidan</i> - Take dictionary form, drop ending `る`, add `られる`

<i>Godan</i> - Take dictionary form, changing ending kana to corresponding `え` sound, add `る`

<i>Formal</i> - Both of the above forms end in `る`. You actually just end up with an Ichidan verbal. So just replace `る` with `ます`

<br />

Uses: Expressing the ability to do a certain action.

`平仮名は書けます` - "(I) can write hiragana"

`彼は動けば、僕は行けます` - "If he moves, I can go"

`助けられなかった` - "I was not able to help"

<hr />
<h3>Particles</h3>

The verbal you get turns out to be an affective verbal, since being able to do something is not due to human volition. So, you can't use `を`, and should should `は` or `が` instead.

`お酒は飲めるよ` - "(I) can drink alcohol"

`パイが食べられなければ、こちらの方行って下さい` - "If you cannot eat pie, please go this way"

<hr />
<h3>Exceptions</h3>

1 - `する` is special, as it just turns into the verb `できる`. This is for "suru" verbals as well.

`結婚できない` - "I can't get married"

`日本語は五時間勉強できた` - "I was able to study japanese for 5 hours"

<br />

2 - `見える` means to be visible. You use it instead of conjugating `見る`, only if you are talking about the visibility of something. Other cases, conjugate `見る`

`曇りであれば、オフィスは見えない` - "If it is cloudy, the office is not visible"

`わたしがお金があったら、映画は見られます` - "If I had money, I could watch the movie". Though `わたしがお金があったら、映画を見ることできる` is more common.

<br />

3 - `聞こえる` means to be audible. Same usage as `見える` above. If you want the other meanings besides to be audible, conjugate `聞く`

`おそすぎて先生聞けませんでした` - "I was too late to ask the teacher"

`ここから歌手の声は聞こえない` - "I can't hear the singer's voice from here"

<br />

4 - `ある` combines with `得る` (to produce) to get `あり得る`. The reading can be either `ありえる` or `ありうる`, but if conjugated (ex. to a tense) the `え` reading is used.

`そんなことはありうる` - "That situation is possible (can exist)" 

`そんなことはありえない` - "This situation is not possible (cannot exist)"

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

`結婚` - Means "marriage". Pronounced "kekkon". Suru Verbal

`曇り` - Means "cloudy". Pronounced "kumori"

`得る` - Means "to get / earn / aquire". Pronounced "eru". Radicals "loiter", "sun" and "measurement"?
