So we have only learned `と`. But there are lots of other ways. Will update as I learn.

<h3>と and も</h3>

`と` and `も` are used to connect different nouns together to form an inclusive group. Similar to English "and", forms a inclusive group of all of the nouns it connects. 

`も` is used as "both", adds more emphasis. You get a noun compound afterwards.

Ex.

`僕と母と父と兄` - "Me, my mother, my father, and my older brother"

`宿題も仕事も` - "Both homework and work"

<h3>や and とか</h3>

`や` and `とか` are similar to `と` in that they form a list of nouns, but they add the implication that not all items in the list may apply, and that there may be others that are unlisted. Similar to English "and/or, ... etc" or "things like ...".

Difference is that `とか` is more colloquial and casual.

Ex.

`新しい靴とかシャツとかズボンは要るの` - "I need new (things like) shoes, shirts, and pants (and others)"

`何がありますか？じゃあ、車や飛行機や戦車があります` - "What is there? Well, there are (things like) cars, planes, and tanks (etc.)"

<h3>か</h3>

Can be used to connect multiple nouns to give the English meaning of "or". Note it is actually the same as the `か` question particle. This is just a contraction of multiple sentence fragment questions. Used mainly for casual. For formal, you can use `又は` for "or/otherwise" or just use sentence fragments.

`今日か明日がいいと思っている` - "I think today or tomorrow is good"

`これかこれかこれができる` - "I can do this, this, or this"

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

- `靴` seen it around. Means "shoe". Pronounced "kutsu".
