We've learnt some in class. The rest are pretty simple. Note, these are mostly nominals, so you can modify them with other classes of words accordingly.

<hr />
<h3>Only X / All there is, is X</h3>

Learned this one in class already.

<u>Structure: </u>  `だけ` or `のみ`. Nominal afterwards

`のみ` is more formal/written, rarely used. `だけ` more common.

Ex. 

`これだけですか` - "Is this all (you have)?"

`五百円だけでは、だめです` - "Only 500 yen is not good" / "It only being 500 yen, it is not good"

`学生のみが入られる` - "Only students are able to enter"

<hr />
<h3>Lack Of Everything Else Besides X</h3>

<u>Structure: </u> `しか`. You get a nominal. MUST end with negative predicate.

Ex.

`食べることしかできません` - "I can't do anything besides eat"

`これしかありめあせん` - "There is nothing but this"

`これから頑張るしかない` - "From now on, we can't do anything except try our best"

Alternative: `っきゃ` can also be used. It is more strong, but rarely used.

<hr />
<h3>Nothing else besides X</h3>

Here we are emphasizing that there is so much X, that there is nothing else. While `しか` emphasizes the lack of everything else. `だけ` is relatively neutral, without any of these implications.

<u>Structure: </u> `ばかり`. `ばっかり` or `ばっか` in casual situations. Get a Nominal

Ex.

`先生と遊ぶばかりでしょうね` - "You only hang out with Sensei (all the time), huh?"

`最近は仕事ばっかだよ` - "Recently, it's been nothing but work"

<hr />
<h3>Too much of X</h3>

By itself, `すぎる` (`過ぎる`) means "to exceed". But when formed specially with other words, the meaning changes (a bit).

<u>Structure: </u> Verbal Stem / Adjectival (i-removed) / Nominal + `すぎる`. For negatives, remove `い` from `ない` and replace with `さ`, then add `すぎる`. You end with an ichidan verbal.

`また食べ過ぎました` - "I ate too much again"

`さながきれいすぎるねえ` - "Sana is too pretty"

`飲みすぎませんでしたよ` - "I didn't drink too much"

`高すぎません` - "It is not too expensive"

`多すぎた` - "It was too much"

Note: You can also just use the stem `すぎ` as a noun.

`ゲームをしすぎはだめよ` - "Playing too much games is bad"

<hr />
<h3>Excessive amounts (with particles)</h3>

<u>Structure: </u> Add the `も` particle after an amount expression. Implies that the amount is a lot, and too much.

`メッセージを三回もしたよ` - "I did THREE messages!"

`今年、十キロも太っちゃった` - "This year, I gained ten WHOLE KG" / "This year, I got ten WHOLE KG fatter..."

<hr />
<h3>Expressing the Extent</h3>

Learned this one in class as well.

<u>Structure: </u> `ほど` can be used as a noun, or directly as a particle.

`彼ほど忙しくない` - "I am not as busy as him"

Some other usages with this, but I feel it doesn't really belong here. It's the one where "the more you X the more you Y"

<hr />
<h3>Amount of Adjective</h3>

You get the "amount" version of the adjective

<u>Structure: </u> Adjectival minus i + `さ` or Nominal + `さ`

`この建物の高さはなんですか` - "What is the height of this building?"

`さなのきれいさすごいですよね` - "The prettiness / beauty of Sana is amazing, isnt it"

<br />

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

- none
