Used a bunch of different videos. Just flattened some chicken breasts, flour, egg, bread crumbs. Fried, then put a slice of cheese on... Don't have to use that many pots if u just sprinkle the flower on. It's a pretty plebian way to do it

<b>Thoughts:</b>


It's pretty good. Idk how to not burn the breadcrumbs tho. Maybe next time we make them super thin and only cook for like 2 min on each side. Pretty solid as a snack later too. Though we might wanna up the class on this and not used sliced cheese. Goes good with rice or pasta. Can use tomato sauce, but I don't really like tomato sauce

<b>Tier:</b> C. Maybe If I knew how to do it better it would be higher, but it makes a mess. Though its much less messy and time than wings.

this fed me for like 4 meals
