We have not learned this formally yet. But reached it in LingoDeer and it doesn't seem too bad.

<h3>ほう</h3>

The kanji is `方`, which we learned, but here it has the `ほう` reading and "method/option" meaning. Treat it like a nominal. You can use it for explaining what option/outcome is more X.

Ex.

`泳ぐほうがいいだと思う` - "I think it is better to swim"

`この赤い本のほうが高いよ` - "This book is more expensive"

`学生じゃないほうが安いですかね` - "It is cheaper if you are not a student"

Past tense adds more certainty and confidence

`こちらへ行った方が早かった` - "It is faster to go this way"

But negative past tense can ONLY be used with past tense predicates.

`そのパーテイに行かなかったほうがよかったですね` - "It was better to have not gone to that party"

Careful cause there is also negative imperfective + past

`そのパーテイに行かないほうがよかったです` - "It would have been better to not go to that party"

<hr />
<h3>より</h3>

`より` is used here as "more than", "opposed to", "rather than". The thing it attaches to is not as X as the other thing. You also use it as a particle (i guess...)

Ex.

`牛肉が魚よりおいしい` - "Beef is more delicious than fish"

You can also use `ほう` with it to add more of a comparison effect.

`書くほうが聞くより易しいと思います` - "Compared to listening, I think writing is easier"

And sometimes, the comparison object is implied.


`仕事がないよりよろしいよ` - "It's better than not having a job"

<hr />
<h3>ほど</h3>

We've seen `ほど` before as a particle marking the extend of an approximation. We can use it here to mark that "somethis is not as X as N". But it can only be used with NEGATIVE predicates. Remember the N with `ほど` is the more X noun.

Ex.

`アメリカは日本ほど楽しくないよ` - America is not as fun as Japan.

<hr />
<h3>Questions</h3>

Two main forms were introduced in LingoDeer:

`バスケと野球とどちらが面白いですか` - "Which is more interesting, basketball or baseball?"

`このドレスの中でど、どれが一番好きでかす` - "Among these dresses, which do you like the most?"

And, you can use the same form (replacing the interogatives) for a verbose answer.
