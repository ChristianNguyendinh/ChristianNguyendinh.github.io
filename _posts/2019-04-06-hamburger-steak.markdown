<b>Thoughts:</b>

It was actually really good. The sauce especially. Very unhealthy it felt like tho. Also i used like month old beef so that was kinda bad. But i went through this very quick. Super easy to eat. Not too bad to make either

<hr />

<b>Tier:</b> B. Pretty good. Tasted quite heavy and unhealthy tho. Maybe need to pair with vegetables or something. Also use newer beef. Kinda requires a lot of ingredients too
