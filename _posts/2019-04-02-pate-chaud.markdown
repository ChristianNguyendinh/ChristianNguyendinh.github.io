<b>Thoughts:</b>

Pretty top tier. Tastes like a desert with meat in eat. Quite greasy tho. Does not feel healthy at all. Not that hard to make either. Just a little messy and you need a brush for the egg stuff. With a spoon did not go too well at all.

<b>Tier:</b> A. Becaue it tastes very unhealthy
