Learned this already, but the third person form is new. Not too bad at all

Sources:

JSL Textbook

<hr />
<h3>First Person / As a Question</h3>

Verb - Take pre-`ます` form / `い` form, add the adjectival `たい`.

Noun - Use the adjectival `欲しい`. (Takes `が` particle for object).

Ex.

`このケーキを食べたいです` - "I want to eat this cake"

`新しい枕がほしいです` - "I want a new pillow"

<hr />
<h3>Third Person</h3>

You don't know what is in another person's heart, so you use `がる` ("to show signs of thinking").

Verb - Take pre-`ます` form / `い` form, add the connect to verbal `たがっています`.

Noun - Use the verbal `欲しがっています`. (Takes `を` particle for object).

Ex.

`彼はこのケーキを食べたがっています` - "He wants to eat this cake"

`彼女は新しい枕を欲しがっている` - "She wants a new pillow"

<hr />
<h3>Want Something to be Done for You</h3>

Structure: `て`-form verbal + `欲しい` adjectival / `もらい` + `たい` adjectival / `いただき` + `たい` adjectival.

`いただきたい` is the humble version.

Same rules as above for third person. Use `に` for the person who is performing the action for you.

Ex.

`ジムさんにスーパーで人参を買ってほしいです` - "I want Jim to buy carrots at the super market (for me)"

`あなたは私に本を読んでもらいたいですか` - "Do you want me to read a book (for you / to you)"

`ジム先生にいらっしゃっていただきたい` - "I want Jim Sensei to come (for me)"

<hr />
<h3>Invitations</h3>

You don't use the want/desire form to invite people to do things in Japanese. Instead, you use negative questions.
