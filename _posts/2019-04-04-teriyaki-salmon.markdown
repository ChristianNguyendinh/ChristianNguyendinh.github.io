<b>Thoughts:</b>

Quite damn good. Pretty simple and quick to make. Only need to watch out for overcooking the salmon (which i did). It's kinda hard not to with mixing in and thickening the sauce at the end. Just need to figure out a side. I guess rice would've worked. But all i had was bread and siracha mayo at the time.

<b>Tier:</b> A. Almost top tier, need to not overcook next time.
