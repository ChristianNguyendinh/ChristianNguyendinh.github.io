Going to keep a list of particles that I have researched, outside of class, to have a unified access point.

`は` - for now I think we have learned enough from class about this one. Though I have seen some uses which I'm a little iffy on. See class notes for now.

`が` - Haven't seen any uses that confused me. See class notes.

`を` - Haven't seen any uses that confused me. See class notes.

`と` - <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-08-japanese-to-particle %}">01/08/19 post</a>
