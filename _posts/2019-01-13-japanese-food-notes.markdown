Kanji has different pronunciations so a lot of the time I'm pretty confused on which pronunciation to use. I'll write down the one's that I find useful that are related to food, here.

<b>ねぎ玉牛丼</b>

Pronounced: `ねぎたまぎゅうどん`

Means: Means beef rice bowl with green onion and (raw) egg. 

Notes: `玉` is used for egg, and just shortened to `たま`. Originally from `卵` or `玉子`. `玉` also has an alternative meaning of "jewel" or something like that, and is also used for egg when dealing with sushi toppings. Though in that case it is pronounced `ぎょく`.
