Hear this all the time in shows and stuff. Not too bad. Sometimes hard to figure out the correct one tho.

<hr />
<h3>あげる</h3>

Means "to give" (as a favor) from the POV of the giver. Subject is the giver, and the person speaking is also the giver. Essentially, it is used similar to humble polite. You use it for your in group when giving a favor to the outgroup. For verbs, use the te form.

Ex.

`僕が僕の食べ物を友達にあげた` - "I gave my food to a friend (as a favor)"

`早く終わってあげました` - "I finished it early (as a favor to you)"

`学生が先生にこのプレセントをあげる` - "The students will give the teacher this present"

`母にこの本を買ってあげよう` - "Let's buy this book and give it to mother"

<u>やる</u> could replace `あげる` if the receiver is a pet, animal, etc.

Ex.

`犬に餌をやった` - "I gave the dog its food"

<hr />
<h3>くれる</h3>

Also means "to give" (as a favor) but from the POV of the receiver. The subject is the giver, but the person speaking is the receiver. Similar to honorific polite. When outgroup does favor for the ingroup.

`友達が私にプレゼントをくれた` - "My friend gave a present to me"

`僕と先生が会ってくれる` - "Teacher will meet with me (as a favor)"

`先生が学生にこのプレセントをくれる` - "Teacher will give this present to the students"

<hr />
<h3>もらう</h3>

Means "to recieve". Subject is the reciever. Only one form, unlike the two above.

`私が友達にプレゼントをもらった` - "I received a present from my friend"

`兄に宿題をしてもらう` - "I will have my brother do homework (as a favor for me)"

<hr />
<h3>Asking for favor</h3>

Traditionally, can ask for things with `ください`. But, alternatively, you can use `くれる` or the potential form `もらえる` to add the meaning of "asking for a favor".

`お金を貸してくれますか` - "Can you do me a favor and lend me some money?"

`宿題を見せてくれる？` - "Can you do me a favor and show me your homework?"

`お菓子を買ってもらえる？` - "Can you buy me some sweets?"

`漢字で書いてもらえませんか` - "Can you write it in Kanji for me?"
