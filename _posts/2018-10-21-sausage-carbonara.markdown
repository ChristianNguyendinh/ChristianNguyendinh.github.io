<b>Thoughts:</b>


30 minutes. Few ingredients. The only annoying thing is rolling the sausage into balls, which can suck to do. But everything else is super simple, and can do while multi tasking. Sausage is good, esp. if u get the disguistingly unhealthy preseasoned kind, then season it more. Pasta with egg mix is good, but this time I don't think I put enough. Also, i dried out pretty easy. Maybe save more pasta water next time to put in the egg mix.

<b>Tier:</b> A. But only because I am not too good at making it yet.
