So we have only learned the "te" form for this. But there are lots of other ways. I probably won't get to them all here, so I'll update this as I learn new ones

<h3>て form</h3>

So this is the only one we have learned in class. I won't go through how to form it. It kind of sucks for verbs.

But, you can use it for connecting predicates in parallel ("and"), sequentially, or imply a cause.

Ex.

`事故で、遅くなった` - "I was late because of an accident"

`美味しくてきれいなの` - "It is delicious and beautiful"

`毎朝起きて朝ごはんを食べて学校に出てる` - "I wake up every morning, eat breakfast, and go to school"

<hr />
<h3>し</h3>

<u>Structure: </u> Direct Predicate + `し`

<u>Use: </u> For listing predicates. Implies that there is more to the list. Can also show reason or contrast. Similar to `て` form in this regard, but `し` is more colloquial and very informal (even "unintellectual"). It can also end a sentence, which works like `て` form too in that the reason or following part is implied or known, or to imply that there are more things part of the list. Can also be used as a sentence ender to make it more colloquial.

Ex.

`雨が降っているし、もう帰ります` - "It is raining, so I will go home now"

`遊びに行きたいし、宿題はしなくてはいけないし、どうしよう` - "I want to go play, but I have to do homework, what do I do?"

`サナがきれいだし美しいし優しいしすごいよ` - "Sana is pretty, beautiful, kind, and amazing"

`先生だし、年上だし, ...` - "It's because she is a teacher, and older, and ..."

`日本語の勉強は難しいけど楽しいし、やりがいもある` - "Studying japanese is difficult but rewarding"

`そのレストランは安いし、美味しいからしょっちゅう食べてるよ` - "This resturant is cheap and tasty, so I eat there all the time"

<hr />
<h3>たり</h3>

<u>Structure: </u> Predicate plain perfective + `り` ... after last `たり` add `する`

<u>Use: </u> For creating a list of things, mainly V, but sometimes used for N and A too. You can also use it once for things like conditionals and stuff, but won't get into that.

Ex.

`休日は、食べたり寝たりして過ごしています` - "I spend my days off eating and sleeping"

`寝たり、本を読んだりするのが好き` - "I like to sleep and read books"

<hr />
<h3>ながら</h3>

Guess this doesn't really belong here, but whatever.

<u>Structure: </u> Raw A/N or Pre-masu V + `ながら`

<u>Use: </u> If used with V, indicates verb is happening "at the same time" or "while" the predicate is happening. With A/N can show predicate "even while" / "despite that" the A/N.

Ex.

`テレビを見ながら、宿題をする` - "Do homework while watching TV"

`食べながら話すのはだめだよ` - "It's not good to talk while eating"

`子供ながら料理が上手のね` - "Even while being a child, he is good at cooking"

`このホテルは小さいながらもいいホテルだと思っている` - "Despite this hotel being small, I think it is a good hotel"

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

- `子供`. Don't know the second kanji, but seen this word everywhere. Means "kid" or "children". Pronounced "kodomo".

- `やりがい`. Means to "be worth doing".

- `しょっちゅう`. Means "always" / "constantly" / "frequently".

- `過ごす`. Never seen before. Means "to spend/pass (time)". Pronounced "sugosu".

- `遊ぶ`. Know the word, never seen the kanji. Means "to play" / "to hang out". Pronounced "asobu".
