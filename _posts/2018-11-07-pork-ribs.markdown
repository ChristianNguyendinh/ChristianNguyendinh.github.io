<b>Thoughts:</b>


Gotta prep this in advance. But its insanely low effort. Oven does everything. Top tier taste. Only issue is its usually a lot, so probably unproductive afterwards. Also its a little messy to eat. Prolly need something to go with it. We usually do mac and cheese. But maybe we should eat more veggies in the future. Need to find a way to drain the fluid after it cooks without just dumping into the sink. Cause this gets some of it below the tin foil layer, and fucks with the pan once you broil.

<b>Tier:</b> S. But you die afterwards
