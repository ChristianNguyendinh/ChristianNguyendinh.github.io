<h3>Display:</h3>

<b>Block</b> – (Default) Preserve preset width/height, gets its own line.

<b>Inline</b> – Position on the same line, set width/height to minimum in order to wrap around inner element

<b>Inline-block</b> – Position on the same line, preserve preset width/height

<b>None</b> – Doesn’t show up at all.

<h3>Position:</h3>

<b>Static</b> – Default, keeps the flow, etc. Also ignores position offsets (top, left, etc.)

<b>Relative</b> – Keeps the flow, can offset it by its original static position

<b>Absolute</b> – Out of the flow. Offsets are in respect to the parent div IF parent is relative or absolute, else, the offsets are in respect to the page itself. Ignores floats.

<b>Fixed</b> – Completely out of the flow, offsets are in relation to the page itself, does not scroll, always stays in same position no matter scrolling. Ignores floats.

<h3>Float:</h3>

<b>Left</b> – Slams element over to the left. Preserves width/height. Slams same floated elements into each other on the same line. Float ignores display, but respects the relative position.

<b>Right</b> – Same as left, but right.

<b>None</b> – (Default), nothing really happens…

<b>Clear</b> – (Left, Right, Both). Used in an element after a float, causes this element to be put on a different line than the previously defined element with parameter float value
