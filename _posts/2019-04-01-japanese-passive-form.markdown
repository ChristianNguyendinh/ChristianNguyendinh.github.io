We haven't learned this in class yet. Apparently it is used quite a bit, encouraged actually. Unlike in English where passive voice ("being") is discouraged.

<h3>Passive Form</h3>

<u>Structure:</u>

<i>Ichidan Verbs</i> - Drop `る`, add `られる`. Damn shame this is the exact same as potential form.

<i>Godan Verbs</i> - change last kana like you are making a negative (go to `あ` sound except `う` => `わ`), then add `れる`

<i>Exceptions</i> - `する` => `される`, `くる` => `こられる`. Similar structure to causative.

Do note that after conjugation, you get an ichidan verb, which can be conjugated and distal'ed accordingly

<br />

<u>Uses:</u> 

Same as in English. Passive verbs are done to the (passive) subject. Passive form is encouraged in Japanese. Removes a level of directness => more polite. 

It appears that `に` is used for the actual subject, while the normal subject particles are used for the passive subject. Makes a little sense since the action is being done "by" the actual subject? I guess?

`パンがボブさんに食べられた` - "Bread was eaten by Bob"

`この教科書は多くの人に読まれている`- "This textbook is being read by many people"

`外国人に質問を聞かれたが、答えられなかった` - "I was asked a question by a foreigner, but I was not able to answer". First is passive, second is potential. ahaha

`明日の会議に行かれるんですか`- "Are you going to tomorrow's meeting?". Lit: "It it that tomorrow's meeting will be went to by you?". More polite.

I think you will need to do a lot of external reading to internalize which scenarios to use this in.

After some practice, it feels like whenever I use passive in English, either the subject doesn't matter, or the object needs to be emphasised.

<h3>Vocab:</h3>

Here are some kanji from the lessons that I wasn't really familiar with at this point:

- `会議`. We know the word and the first kanji. Pronounced "kaigi". Means "meeting/conference".

- `質問`. We know the word and the second kanji. Pronounced "shitsumon". Means "qustion".
