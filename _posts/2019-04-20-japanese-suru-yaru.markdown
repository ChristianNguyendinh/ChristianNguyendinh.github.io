Both mean "to do", but there are some slight differences. But they are not to bad at all. Though there are specific instances where one is preferred over the other (like set phrases or just common occurences). But some other times, they can just be interchanged.

<h3>やる</h3>

- Used standalone usually
- Standalone, rougher version of `する` and `あげる` (haven't learned that one yet)
- Can only be used for physical actions that you voluntarily do with a certain amount of time and effort
- Cannot use with some nouns (some are not physical, but others like "telephone" cannot be done). Though some can be used along with a particle
- Has some specific grammar patterns and set phrases that use it (`やった!`). Also, when used standalone, has some implied meanings (like to kill or have sex). Similar to English "shall we do it?"

<h3>する</h3>

- More "formal" in interchangable situation
- Often used as a part of `する` verbs (Nominal + `する` compound words)
- General term for "to do". Can be used for abstract things like to imagine.
- Has some set phrases that use it (like `に` + `する` = to make, to choose (when shopping))
