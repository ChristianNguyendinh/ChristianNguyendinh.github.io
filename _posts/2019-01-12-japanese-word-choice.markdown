There are obv words with similar meanings. Tho sometimes the meanings are too similar and I'm not quite sure what the minute differences are. I'll keep a list of some differences I find useful to remember.

<hr />

<b>Last</b>

The two I've found are `最後` and `最終`.

We already know the kanji `後` (usually `ご`) which represents after, later, behind, etc. The new kanji `最` (`さい` / `しゅ`) means the most or extreme. The other new kanji `終` (`しゅう`) is made up of two kanji we have seen before. It means end or finish.

Both words mean "last" but have slightly different uses.

`最後` is attached to other nominals with `の` like a normal nominals. Sorta roughly means "end". Implied meaning of the end of something that will never happen again. But another important use is that it can also mean the "latest" or "most recent", which `最終` cannot be used for.

`最終` i guess is what our book calls "degree nominals" and can attach to other nominals directly. Sorta roughly means "final". Implied meaning of the thing that will happen after all other things. So its "last" with a given frame of reference.

Though, with those implied differences, when used to modify nouns, most of the time, they can be used interchangably. Though remember to use `最後` if you want to say the "latest" or "most recent".

Ex.

`最終電車はいつが出ますか` - When will the last train leave?

`最終決は決まりました` - The final decision has been decided.

`最終試験` - Final exam

`これは僕の最終試合です` - This is my last (final) match (in a series).

`これは僕の最後の試合です` - This is my last match (forever).

`最後のページ` - Last (final, ending) page

`これは僕が買った最後のゲームです` - This is the last (most recent) game I bought.
