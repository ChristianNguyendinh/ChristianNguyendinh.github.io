So it turns out the react syntax I was learning was ES5, and theres been ES6 for a while now… what the fuuuuckckk. Guess I’ll have to learn the new syntax now. Doesn’t seem too much to change, just gotta make sure I properly bind this… besides that not much changes besides not using createClass() anymore.

I haven’t started anything concrete with it yet… so I’ll just wait and start a fresh project with ES6 after I learn some last things about React/Django
