In class i've only learned the first "and" use for this particle. But apparently it is used for a lot more.

<hr />
<h4><u>"and"</u></h4>

Connects two or more nominals together and links them in a similar fashion to English "and". Forms a combined nominal with all the linked sub nominals.

`赤と青と緑` - "red and blue and green"

`私と友達` - "my friends and I" - In Japanese, self usually comes first.

<hr />
<h4><u>"with"</u></h4>

Can be put after a nominal for the English meaning of "with" or "together with".

`私の友人と` - "with my friend"

`父は母と買い物に行きました` - "dad went shopping with mom"

<hr />
<h4><u>Comparison</u></h4>

Can be used for comparing and contrasting nominals. Use after each nominal you are comparing.

`日本語と英語と、どちらの方がいいですか` - "Which is better, Japanese or English?" / "Is Japanese or English better?"

<hr />
<h4><u>Conditional</u></h4>

The word "conditional" kinda confuses me in regards to this usage, cause I thought there was a conditional form for verbals?. You can put it after a verbal or nominal to form a conditional statement. Similar to English "when" or "if".

`家に帰ると誰もいませんでした` - "When I got home, nobody was there"

`高いと、買いません` - "If it is expensive, I will not buy it". I guess "When it is expensive, I will not buy it" kinda works. Makes sense with the usage too.

`あの店に行くと安いゲームを買えます` - "If you go to that store, you can buy cheap games" / "When you go to that store, you can buy cheap games"

<hr />
<h4><u>Quotations</u></h4>

Can be used to mark the end of a thought or quotation. Often follows a verb, and precedes `言う` / `思う` / `聞く`.

`面白かったと思いました` - "I thought it was interesting"

`面白かったと思います` - "I think it was interesting"

`面白いと思います` - "I think it is interesting". I'm honestly not sure the exact implied meaning differences between these three. I know Sensei said something about making something like `よかった友達です` vs. `いい友達でした`. First adds an implied meaning that the person "was" a good friend, but now isn't. Second is just that person was a good friend. Not sure is some implied meaning comes into play here too.

`緑だったと聞きます` - "I hear (heard) is was green"

`彼は私が明日学校に来ると言いました` - "He said I will come to school tomorrow"

<hr />
<h4><u>Sound Words</u></h4>

Can be used with onomatopoetic words.

`犬がワンワンと吠えている` - "The dog is crying 'bark bark'"

<hr />
<h4><u>As a conditional</u></h4>

<hr />
<h4><u>with なる</u></h4>

Add nominal plus to combined with `なる` (to become / reach / attain) (`となる`) to indicate something reaches a goal / new state. Used to indicate a change or result.

`強いとなった` - "It became strong"

<hr />
<h4><u>with 同じ</u></h4>

Add nominal plus to combined with `同じ` (`と同じ`) to say the same as nominal. Though sometimes the particle `に` (`に同じ`) is used instead.

`私と同じ仕方` - "the same way (of doing) as me" 

`友達と同じ` - "the same as my friends". Compare to `同じ友達`, which means "the same friends".

* Those last two I just found randomly while searching, so there are probably some more obscure uses that I am missing.
