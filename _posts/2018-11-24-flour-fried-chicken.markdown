<b>Thoughts:</b>


god tier meal. Makes a mess, takes a long time, uses a lot of ingredients inefficiently, wastes a lot, but it tastes amazing. Especially if you eat it with a fat sauce combo. The most top tier of top tier meals. Though an issue is that it takes a while to fry, so some pieces get cold by the time you get to them.
