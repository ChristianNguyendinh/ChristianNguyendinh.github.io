We haven't learned this in class yet. Seems a little wierd. Not sure how useful it'll be, but it leads into other stuff.

<h3>Causative Form</h3>

Structure:

<i>Ichidan Verbs</i> - Drop `る`, add `させる`

<i>Godan Verbs</i> - change last kana like you are making a negative (go to `あ` sound except `う` => `わ`), then add `せる`

<i>Exceptions</i> - `する` => `させる`, `くる` => `こさせる`

Do note that after conjugation, you get an ichidan verb, which can be conjugated and distal'ed accordingly

<br />

Uses: An action that someone makes happen. Can also be an action that someone let happens. To make or let someone do something. Hard to tell the difference, but if `あげる` or `くれる` (`ください`) come after, it almost always means "let".

`全部買わせた` - "Made/let (someone) buy it all"

`全部買わせてくれる`, `全部買わせてあげる` - "Let someone buy it all"

`今週は宿題を休ませてください` - "This week, please let me rest from homework"

`先生が学生に宿題をたくさんさせる` - "That teacher makes students do a lot of homework"

<hr />
<h3>Permission</h3>

It is much more common to use `てもいい` to ask for permission instead of causative form. Sounds like what a "prisoner" would say.

`トイレに行ってもいいですか` - "Can I go to the bathroom?"

`この鉛筆使ってもいいですか` - "Can I use this pencil"

<hr />
<h3>Shortened Form</h3>

Basically, `せる` is shortened to `す`. Tho this is a very rough conjugation, not used too often (IRL anyway).

Structure:

<i>Ichidan Verbs</i> - Drop `る`, add `さす`

<i>Godan Verbs</i> - change last kana like you are making a negative (go to `あ` sound except `う` => `わ`), then add `す`

<i>Exceptions</i> - `する` => `さす`, `くる` => `こさす`

<br />

Examples:

`私が彼にまたさした` - "I made him do it again"

`僕が質問をたくさん聞かしてくれた` - "I let (them) ask a lot of questions.
