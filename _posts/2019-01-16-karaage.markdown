<b>Thoughts:</b>


Similar to fried chicken, but this one has more taste because of the marination. Also, we don't have to waste a bunch of stuff for breading, since we just mix the potato starch / flour directly into the bowl we used for marination. Much quicker process than the friend chicken. Need to work on the marination a bit tho, the flavor was good, but not my favorite.

I also tried a mayo/mustard/honey sauce for dipping. Was very fatty
