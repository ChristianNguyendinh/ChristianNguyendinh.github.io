<h3>しまう</h3>

This verb can mean to complete fully (usually written in its kanji: `仕舞う`). It can also sound similarly to some other words. But in most cases, it indicates some unintentional or regrettable action. Usually used along with the `て` form of a verb.

Ex.

`宿題をすることを忘れてしまった` - "I (unintentionally) forgot to do my homework!"

`ケーキすぎを食べるから太ってしまいました` - "I (regrettably) got fat because I ate too much cake"

`まだ仕事を終わって仕舞ったよ` - "I already finished all my work". Care, could be the regular use for "to complete fully"

<hr />
<h3>ちゃう/じゃう</h3>

You can shorten the `て` + `しまう` to `ちゃう` in casual situations. For `で` endings, you change it to `じゃう`. In addition to the uses above, this is can also used to sound more childish or show more emotion / feeling. Often used by females for this reason.

`これ食べちゃっていい?` - "Is it okay to eat this?" 

`あなたが好きになっちゃった` - "I've started to like you"

`じゃあ、電話番号、教えちゃおうかな` - "Then, should I give you my phone #?"

`困っちゃう` - "I will be in trouble" (girly)

`殺しちゃった` - "I (unintionally) killed (it)"

<hr />
<h3>Standalone</h3>

Often used standalone to indicate "damn!" / "shoot!" / "look what i did!". Not always negative connotation, but sometimes is.

`しまった!` - "Damn it!" / "Shoot!"
